# 3Columns-Bootstrap-Version

# Project Description

This project will focuses on showcasing my basic skills on responsive design using Bootstrap component.

The project is for cars manufacturing company.

The project has a parent container named 'container' where a 'grid container' was nested within it. There are three columns embedded within the 'grid container' , each one column was spanned to four columns from mediun-devices up to extra-extra-large. Therefore they will all span to 12 columns on extra-small and small mobiles.
For each one column there is a card nested, containing the image of the car, its name, about the car and a button link that will redirect the client to learn more about the car.

The font-families used was ('Lexend Deca', and 'Big Shoulders'), while font-weight happen to be 700, and 400 acrossed the project entirely, the font-sizes used are 15px and 20px.
There are some attributes that were not documented in Bootstrap. Nevertheless I used custom Css to customize them, and I have assigned the Bootstrap to be responsible for their behavior.
These attributes are: Background-color, color, font-families, font-sizes, and button. the rest part of the project was customized using Bootstrap's documentations.
